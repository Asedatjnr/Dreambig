The learning environment is more dynamic than ever before. <br> As a result, today’s students learn in ways that are <br> very different <br> from how our educational system was originally designed. <br> With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and the rise of remote/hybrid learning, <br> the idea of the classroom is being remodeled and redefined in a number of <br> ways to fit the evolving needs of modern digital learners.
Many Higher Education <br> Institutions are substituting <br> traditional resources with educational technologies to <br> keep up with their digital learning population. <br> Below we’ve listed why adopting a learning strategy that embraces <br> technology in the classroom environment can improve engagement <br> and increase student success rates.Technology provides <br> students with instant access to a vast amount of information <br> and resources. The internet and digital tools allow students to explore various subjects, conduct research, and access educational materials that may not be available in traditional textbooks. <br> Here are some concrete examples of how students can use technology to enhance their learning:
Digital Libraries: <br> Digital libraries or online databases allow students to access various <br> academic and research materials, <br>including e-books, scholarly articles, journals, <br> and multimedia content that can support their learning.
Online Platforms: Educational platforms and learning management <br> systems (LMS) provide a centralized location for teachers <br> to share resources and for students to access information. <br> These platforms can host digital textbooks, multimedia content, interactive modules, and assignments.</p>
