		<h1>Technology</h1>
		<p>illustration of students on computers
The learning environment is more dynamic than ever before. As a result, today’s students learn in ways that are very different from how our educational system was originally designed. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and the rise of remote/hybrid learning, the idea of the classroom is being remodeled and redefined in a number of ways to fit the evolving needs of modern digital learners.
Many Higher Education Institutions are substituting traditional resources with educational technologies to keep up with their digital learning population. Below we’ve listed why adopting a learning strategy that embraces technology in the classroom environment can improve engagement and increase student success rates.Technology provides students with instant access to a vast amount of information and resources. The internet and digital tools allow students to explore various subjects, conduct research, and access educational materials that may not be available in traditional textbooks. Here are some concrete examples of how students can use technology to enhance their learning:
Digital Libraries: Digital libraries or online databases allow students to access various academic and research materials, including e-books, scholarly articles, journals, and multimedia content that can support their learning.
Online Platforms: Educational platforms and learning management systems (LMS) provide a centralized location for teachers to share resources and for students to access information. These platforms can host digital textbooks, multimedia content, interactive modules, and assignments.</p>
