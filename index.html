The learning environment is more dynamic than ever before. 
<br> As a result, today’s students learn in ways that are 
<br> very different <br> from how our educational system
was originally designed. <br> With the advancement of 
Artificial Intelligence and the rise of remote/hybrid learning, 
<br> the idea of the classroom is being remodeled and redefined 
in a number of <br> ways to fit the evolving needs of modern digital learners.
Many Higher Education <br> Institutions are substituting <br> traditional 
resources with educational technologies to <br> keep up with their digital 
learning population. <br> Below we’ve listed why adopting a learning strategy 
that embraces <br> technology in the classroom environment can improve engagement 
<br> and increase student success rates
